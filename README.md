# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kawser Hamid! 
An enthusiastic software engineer on a continuous learning journey.

I am passionate about sharing what I've learned so far. My areas of focus include technologies such as **C# (.NET Core and .NET Framework), Java (Spring Boot), Python (Django), JavaScript, Angular, React, SQL, and NoSQL Databases**. I believe in the power of code to solve real-world problems and strive to create clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.

I'm excited to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on interesting projects, and share knowledge and experiences. Feel free to reach out to me through email or connect with me on LinkedIn. **Let's embark on this adventure of continuous learning, growth, and professional development together**.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile, and I hope you find something useful in my repositories. Happy coding!

Best regards,<br/>
Kawser Hamid
